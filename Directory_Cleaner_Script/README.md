# 🚀 Task Idea : Directory Cleaner

## 🗒️ Requirements :

  Create a Bash script that cleans up a specified directory by removing files older than a certain number of days.
  
  The script should accept the directory path and the number of days as arguments.
  
  Implement a dry-run option that shows which files would be deleted without actually deleting them

  ## ⌨️ Script_Input :

  ```
  chmod +x Directory_Cleaner.sh
  ./Directory_Cleaner {{directory path}} {{Number of days}}
```
